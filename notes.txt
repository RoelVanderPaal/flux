- observable:
  - only replace different elements in tree => compare with current Node
  - nested observable:
    - unsubscribe (only when different Subscriber?)
    - what about multiple levels of nested Observable?
      - should be handled, because Renderer will not come there anymore, so parent needs list of lower level subscriptions
