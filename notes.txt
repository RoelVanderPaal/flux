- observable:
  - only replace different elements in tree => compare with current Node
  - nested observable:
    - unsubscribe (only when different Subscriber?)
    - what about multiple levels of nested Observable?
      - should be handled, because Renderer will not come there anymore, so parent needs list of lower level subscriptions

x nested observables
- smart css properties
- smart diffing
- should Observables remember by default? or only fold? MemorySubject?
- separate unsafe import
- list handling (with keyby)
- empty element

checklist:
- private where possible?
- unsafe implemented everywhere?
